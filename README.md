# demo-shop
This project is an online store with an admin panel, a profile page, password recovery via email, a shopping cart, and the ability to create, delete and edit products.
When developing this project, I used the following technology stack: Node JS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose. I also used various middleware and a templating engine using Handlebars as an example.
